# I was bored so I did a hungaraian programming competition's programming part

## How to use:

### Plug-and-play:
    Just download the exe you want from the releases (if I forget I may not upload linux executable, but if you're using linux and can't self-comple, what are you even doing on linux?).

### Self-compiling:
    Clone the repo, doubleclick on the PreMake.bat to generate platform-specific workspace/solution, than you do what you want.
    There are 3 configurations set up.

# Tasks:
    You'll probably just have to enter the infos like in the examples in the paper, if not I'll probably print what you need to enter.
