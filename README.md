## How to use:
### Plug-and-play:
<p>Just download the exe you want from the releases (if I forget I may not upload linux executable, but if you're using linux and can't self-comple, what are you even doing on linux?).</p>

### Self-compiling:
<p>Clone the repo, doubleclick on the PreMake.bat to generate platform-specific workspace/solution, than you do what you want.</p>
<p>There are 3 configurations set up.</p>
